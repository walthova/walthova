# Hey, I’m **walthova.eth** 👋🏽
Polymath, creative technologist, community builder. I design culture-grade systems where art, AI, and on-chain coordination feel human, ethical, and teachable.

- 🇵🇦 Panamanian American, raised in Little Rock, based in Los Angeles  
- 🏛 Founder and creative director of **IBG Collection**  
- 🖼 Curator of **Position.gallery** pop-up experiences  
- 🧭 Education and onboarding advocate for AI and crypto  
- 🏆 ETHGlobal NYC award in 2022, ongoing hacker and volunteer

---

## What I care about
- **AI literacy and innovative thinking**: toolkits, workshops, and prompts that make advanced AI usable for newcomers and powerful for pros  
- **Decision intelligence**: simulation-first product thinking, scenario trees, confidence bands, and human-in-the-loop feedback that aligns choices with values  
- **Ethics in AI and blockchain**: consent, provenance, bias awareness, safety-by-default, and transparent governance  
- **Quantum-inspired simulation**: probabilistic reasoning, ensemble models, and narrative playback to explore many futures before committing to one

---

## What I’m building
- **IBG Collection: Optic Relics**  
  Framed garments as living artifacts. Triangle, circle, square as a language of unity. NFC and story layers that preserve memory and provenance.

- **Position.gallery**  
  A traveling gallery and cultural lab where AI art, human craft, and community education meet. ENS-powered identity for collectors and guests.

- **La Familia DAO**  
  A network-city concept that blends simple token membership with real-world coordination. Education first, clear governance, honest incentives.

---

## Pilots and experiments
- **Wear to Earn**: ambassadors unlock benefits by activating art in the world  
- **NFT fashion immersion**: on-chain wardrobe identity, gallery-grade presentation, and owner narratives  
- **ENS-driven pop-ups**: identity, ticketing, and collector provenance for gallery events  
- **AI video storytelling**: hygge.film
